## Overview
 
We ask interview candidates to implement a solution to simple problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
 
The purpose is to get a feel for their experience as well as to form a part of a technical discussion in the interview itself.
 
 
## Instructions
 
Choose 3 from the [first 20 problems](https://github.com/anthillcrm/tech-test/raw/main/ProjectEulerFirst20Problems.docx) in the Project Euler archives. 
 
Implement each of your chosen problems in C#.
 
Ensure that any supplementary code not written by you is marked as such. Be aware that the technical discussion may still touch on these.
 
Once complete, zip and email the source files and any necessary instructions to [careers@anthill.co.uk](mailto:careers@anthill.co.uk)
 
 
## Considerations
 
Some of the problems are more challenging than others. Your implementation choices and the reasoning for your selection will form part of the interview.
 
Copying from e.g. Stack Overflow is not acceptable. We want to see _your_ solution.
